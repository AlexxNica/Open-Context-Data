Open Context Data

Rationale:
Why not? GitHub seems like a good way to share these data in a way that allows for easier transformation, forking, duplication, etc. It will probably be years before someone does something interesting with this dataset, but it's still worth sharing via GitHub.

About these XML Files:
In the "data" directory, different directories are named by the project
ID. Each project directory has an XML file with metadata about the project.
Each project directory will have a "subjects" director (with subject XML
documents belonging to that project). They may also have media and document directories. All the XML documents where checked to be valid/well-formed when exported.They should all be in UTF-8 encoding.


Licence Information: 
Each XML document has a Creative Commons license. Most XML documents a Creative Commons Attribution License, but some have the (dreaded) Non-Commercial restriction. Please respect these licenses for linked media files (mainly pictures). These images are not stored in GitHub but can be discovered through their links.

Source Code:
Yes! Source code is coming soon. I just have to ween myself off of SVN. For now, Open Context source code is here: http://code.google.com/p/opencontext/

It'll get moved to GitHub shortly.
